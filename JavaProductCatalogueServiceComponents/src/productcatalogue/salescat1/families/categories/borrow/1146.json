	"When you take out a personal loan, it is compulsory to have loan protection that will cover the outstanding loan amount should you unfortunately die, become disabled, are retrenched or unable to earn an income while you are still employed.  Our Personal Loan Credit Protection Plan will help pay off the outstanding amount of your personal loan if you cannot honour your repayments for any of these reasons. If you do not want to take out our Personal Loan Credit Protection Plan, you can take out an insurance policy with another insurer of your choice. This policy must offer the benefits that the Credit Life Insurance Regulations of 2017 require. Ask about our loan insurance when you apply for your loan."],
